# CS341 Coursework 
Izzy, Kirsten and Luis' collaborative work on Systems Biology projects. The following noteboooks represent a collaborartive effort between 

The projects in this repository many aspects of Systems Biology. This work largely aims to capture biological processeses and facilitate discovery through the development and analysis of mathematical models. This work is based in python and utilizes matplotlib for visualization purposes. 

Projects numbered 1 through 5 adress the following topics: 

* Formulating models using kinetic equations and formulas 
* Motifs in biological systems
* Simulation techniques (computational methods for solving ODE's) 
* Parameter-fitting through optimization (Genetic Algorthim techniques)
* Sensitivity analysis (assesing model reactions to parametric change)
